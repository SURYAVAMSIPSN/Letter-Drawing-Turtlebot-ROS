# Letter-Drawing-Turtlebot-ROS
A python program which controls the turtlesim robot to draw an alphabetical letter of choice.

The function DrawLetter was written in a class, so it can be used in other programs as well. 
from name_letter import DrawLetter as D
D.draw_letter('M') # can change to letter of choice. 

Letters 'M' and 'X' have been attached as a sample. 

Enjoy!!
